Hello!, I'm Uvaish shaikh(SCSE-Section21) and a first year. I don't really know much about programming, I'm aware of Python and its basics, the loops and how some codes work. I grasp knowledge quick and can implement it quickly. If I were to be given a task and was asked to complete it by a deadline, I'd try to finish the work before the deadline.
